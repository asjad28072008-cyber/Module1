# Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the given number is **even** or **odd** using `if...else` statements.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Get an input from the user.
2. Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable `a`.
3. Use the modulo operator `%` to check if `a % 2 == 0`.
   - If true, print `"EVEN"`.
   - Else, print `"ODD"`.
4. End the program.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
s=int(input ())
if s%2==0:
    print ("EVEN")
else:
    print ("ODD")
```

## Output

# Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False`.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Set variable `a` to the result of the expression `0 == True`.
2. Set variable `b` to the result of the expression `False == False`.
3. Set variable `c` to the result of the expression `True + True`.
4. Set variable `d` to the result of the expression `False + 9`.
5. Print the value of `a` with the label "a is".
6. Print the value of `b` with the label "b is".
7. Print the value of `c` with the label "c:".
8. Print the value of `d` with the label "d:".

## ðŸ’» Program
```
a = (0 == True)
b = (False == False)
c = True + True
d = False + 9

print("a is",a)
print("b is",b)
print("c:",c)
print("d:",d)
```

## Output
```
a is False
b is True
c: 2
d: 9

```
## Result
Thus, the python program was executed successfully





# Datatypes-Character Literal in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that prints the characters `'T'` and `'a'` using character literals.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Print the character `'T'`.
2. Print the character `'a'`.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
print('T')
print("a")
```

## Output
```
T
a
```
## Result
Thus ,the python program is executed successfully




# ðŸ§® Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.
6. Print the imaginary part of `x` using `x.imag`.

## ðŸ’» Program
```
a=int(input())
b=int(input ())
x=complex(a,b)
print(x)
print(x.real)
print(x.imag)
```

## Output

<img width="430" height="325" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-18 211328" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09d0f80f-eb31-4a9e-ae47-570bbb77b97d" />



## Result
Thus , The pyhon program has been executed successfully




# Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign a variable named `men_stepped_on_the_moon`.
2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
men_stepped_on_the_moon=input()
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
```

## Output


<img width="397" height="104" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-18 212236" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ee87643-6b5c-45ae-a86a-f1a502a2bd78" />



## Result
Thus,The python program has been executed Successfully
